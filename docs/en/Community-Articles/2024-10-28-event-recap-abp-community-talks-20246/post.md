**II. Modular Monolith Application Development (Halil İbrahim Kalkan)**

**A. Why Modularity?**

* **Reducing and managing code complexity:** Enables parallel development, simplifies code maintenance, and allows for easier onboarding of new developers.
* **Modular deployment:** Allows customized deployments based on client needs, including or excluding specific modules.
* **Microservice migration:** Provides a foundation for future migration to a microservice architecture.

**B. Module Types:**

* **Business Modules:** Core functionalities directly related to the application’s business logic.
* **Aggregator Modules:** Combine data from multiple modules, typically for reporting or dashboards.
* **Infrastructure Modules:** Provide shared functionalities like settings management, permission management, background jobs, etc.
* **Generic Modules:** Offer cross-cutting concerns like audit logging, GDPR compliance, etc.

**C. Architectural Considerations:**

* **Database:** Single database: Easier for reporting and transactions, with potential scaling limitations.
* **Separate databases:** Improved data isolation, scalability, and more complex reporting and transactions.
* **Codebase:** Single solution: Easier for small teams and rapid development, potential for tighter coupling.
* **Separate solutions:** Encourages module isolation and increased complexity for multi-module development.
* **Monorepo vs. multirepo:** Monorepo simplifies versioning and deployment, while multirepo allows for more independent development.
* **User Interface:** 
  * **Unified UI:** Simpler to develop pages utilizing multiple modules, less modular UI.
  * **Modular UI:** Promotes UI module isolation and challenges in integrating UI across modules.
  * **Component-based UI:** Balances modularity with cross-module integration.

**D. Module Integration:**

* **Dependencies:** Modules should depend on each other’s contracts (interfaces, DTOs, events), not implementations.
* **Communication patterns:** Direct API calls are suitable for read operations and prioritize caching.
* **Integration events:** Best for side effects triggered by changes in one module affecting another.

**E. ABP Framework Tutorial:**

* Demonstrated a step-by-step tutorial available on the ABP Framework website, covering:
* Creating a new solution with ABP Studio.
* Building modules with DDD principles.
* Implementing module integration using services and events.
* Performing database operations across modules.

***
**III. Real-World ABP Experiences (Ariful Islam)**

* Shared experiences from using ABP Framework for various projects, including large-scale SaaS applications.
* Highlighted the benefits of ABP in addressing challenges like:
* Multi-tenancy implementation.
* Supporting both cloud and on-premise deployments.
* Implementing recurring payments with Stripe.
* Building modular applications tailored to diverse customer needs.
* Emphasized the value of ABP’s:
* Pre-built modules and features (multi-tenancy, roles, settings, identity).
* DDD implementation and architectural guidance.
* Documentation and open-source projects as learning resources.
* Customization capabilities through extension methods and data filters.

***
**IV. Q&A Session**

* Addressed various community questions, including:
* Creating projects with multiple modules and Angular UI.
* Availability of simplified module templates.
* Choosing between modular monolith and single-layered architecture.
* Security controls are available in ABP Framework.
* Plans to move away from jQuery in ABP’s UI.

***
**V. Key Takeaways:**

* ABP Framework provides a robust foundation for building modular monolith applications with .NET.
* Modularity offers significant advantages for managing complexity, enabling flexible deployment, and easing potential microservice migration.
* The ABP Framework community is active and offers valuable resources for learning and sharing experiences.
* The ABP team continuously evolves the framework, adds new features, and addresses community needs.

**Quotes:**

> “I honestly did not find any alternative to ABP for SaaS applications. It is very easy to get started.” — Ariful Islam.

> “ABP provides us with nice architecture and nice documentation. We learn a lot from ABP documentation and the projects.” — Ariful Islam.

> “ABP Studio is not a replacement for ABP Suite. You can use ABP Suite to create CRUD pages, and it’s inside ABP Studio.” — Alper Ebicoglu.
