## Explore the CMS Kit Demo Application

As the core ABP development team, we've created a sample application to showcase the incredible capabilities of the ABP's CMS Kit Module. You can explore the source code of the application on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/abpframework/cms-kit-demo) to get a deeper understanding of how the CMS Kit works under the hood. While developing the application, we aimed to build a real-world application and use almost all of the CMS Kit Features.

In the next sections, we will provide a detailed walkthrough of the application and highlight each CMS Kit feature that has been incorporated into it.

### Dynamic Menu Creation with CMS Kit's Menu System

One of the standing out features of the CMS Kit is its [Menu System](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Modules/Cms-Kit/Menus), which allows for the creation and dynamic ordering of application menu items. Say goodbye to static menus; with CMS Kit, you have the power to tailor your menu structure according to your evolving content needs.

You can see the homepage of the application in the following figure:
