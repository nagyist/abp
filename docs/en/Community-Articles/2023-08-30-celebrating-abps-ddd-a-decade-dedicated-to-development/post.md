Today isn't just another day. Today, we celebrate a decade of dedication, innovation, and collaboration. A day that reminds us of the late nights, the brainstorming sessions, the challenges faced, and the solutions found. A decade ago, we started with a simple idea: to make web application development for .NET developers easier and more efficient. This idea wasn't just a fleeting thought; it was a commitment to every .NET developer out there. That commitment was shaped in the form of [open-source ASP.NET Boilerplate project](https://github.com/aspnetboilerplate/aspnetboilerplate).
As we stand at this 10-year mark, it's not just about looking back but also realizing how every step, every feedback, and every update has shaped ABP journey for today.
