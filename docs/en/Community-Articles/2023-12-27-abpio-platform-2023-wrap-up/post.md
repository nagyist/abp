ABP.IO is a comprehensive platform that includes the open-source ABP Framework based on ASP.NET Core and its commercial solution designed on the .NET ecosystem. ABP.IO's purpose is to provide a robust infrastructure for developers to create modern web applications efficiently. As ABP.IO Core Team, we came to this day and are excited for the upcoming days thanks to the ever expanding ABP Community members.

We are grateful for ABP Community including the team members who put effort into making ABP what it is today and the community members for all their amazing support. On top of the achievements in 2022 we summed up in [ABP Year Review 2022 Wrap Up](https://blog.abp.io/abp/ABP-Year-Review-2022-Wrap-Up) blog post for 2022, we, as ABP, achieved even more great successes in 2023 with and thanks to all of you ABP Community members. This year, we remained transparent and committed to our values for trying to help the developers build their web applications efficiently with ABP Framework based on ASP.NET Core.

We will look into ABP.IO Platform 2023 milestones and wrap the year up in this blog post. Before we hop on to the ABP's recap, we'd like to mention the major highlights in .NET ecosystem which is the **release of .NET 8**. In ABP, it's worth mentioning before all that 2023 was the year we celebrated the **10th Year of ABP** and the first year ever we organized a full conference-**ABP .NET Conf'23**! Let's have a look at them and more.

### Anniversary

This year was a special year in which we celebrated the **10th Birthday of the ABP**! Looking back, a decade passed till the very first day of the ABP journey. Words are simply not nearly enough to describe our excitement and how surprised we are since it now feels like a blink aside from all the bitter and sweet moments of our journey. Take a look at the milestones we overcame with you and how the last decade went in [Celebrating ABP's DDD: A Decade Dedicated to Development](https://blog.abp.io/abp/Celebrating-ABP%2527s-DDD%253A-A-Decade-Dedicated-to-Development). We dedicated a full 3-day weekend to celebrate the 10th birthday of ABP with our team. [Take a peak at the 1-minute-video from that weekend](https://youtube.com/embed/LxMqIVNHKOk).
In addition to our celebration, we created ABP Framework swag shop that includes a limited-time swag items that have ABP's special 10th Year logo on them.

Anyone was invited to the event as we mentioned in our [You Are Invited to ABP .NET Conf'23!](https://blog.abp.io/abp/You-Are-Invited-to-ABP-dotNET-Conf23) along with our excitement. It was a truly remarkable experience we got to taste for the first time and got a significant interest.

In addition to organizing our own .NET event, we, of course, also sponsored 5 events in 2023. Here is the list of the events we sponsored:
