#### **What to Expect at [BASTA! 2025](https://basta.net/frankfurt-en/)**
The most exciting part is İsmail Çağdaş from the ABP developer team will be speaking at the conference on March 04 about the concepts of monoliths and microservices will be briefly explored, along with how modular monoliths bring together the advantages of these two architectures. Using the ABP Framework as an example, the session will highlight its modularity features and demonstrate how it can assist in creating and developing a modular monolith application. Finally, best practices for developing modular monoliths will be discussed, showing how these practices can pave the way for transitioning to a microservice-based architecture when necessary.
