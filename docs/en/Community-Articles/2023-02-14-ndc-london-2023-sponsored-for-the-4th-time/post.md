#### **Recap & Impressionsüåü**

Last week, we were just back from¬†[NDC {London}¬†](https://ndclondon.com)after had a blast at Queen Elizabeth II Centre in the center of Westminster, London, UK, with holding a stand on Level 3 during the 3-day conference (24 Jan. - 27 Jan.) introducing about the¬†[ABP.IO](https://abp.io)¬†platform.

We were proud and glad to be a presenting partner of the conference for the 4th time in NDC London, and was able to meet up with other global companies, top experts with their specialties, and the impressive count of attendees.

Our lead developers¬†*[Halil](https://twitter.com/hibrahimkalkan)*¬†and¬†*[Alper](https://twitter.com/alperebicoglu)*¬†presented the ABP.IO platform modules and features were quite busy enjoying their presenting work with latest version of demos.

We introduced¬†**[ABP Framework](https://abp.io)**, community-driven open-source web application framework, and¬†**[ABP Commercial](https://commercial.abp.io)**, our enterprise-ready web development platform that is built on top of the open-source ABP Framework.
