### A Glance Back at BASTA! Mainz 2023





We just came back from the[ BASTA! Conference 2023](https://basta.net/), which is an incredible .NET event with over 600 in-person attendees and an additional 200+ tuning in virtually from across the globe. The buzz of excitement and anticipation in the air was undeniable, setting the stage for an unforgettable event for [ABP.IO](https://abp.io/).

As the lead developers of ABP Core Team, *[Alper](https://twitter.com/alperebicoglu)* and *[Ismail](https://twitter.com/ismcagdas)* presented the ABP.IO platform modules and features were quite busy enjoying their presenting work with latest version of demos. Alper also gave a great speech on “Building Multi-tenant ASP.NET Core Application & the ABP Framework” at the BASTA!
