Hello and gratitude, ABP.IO Community!

It was an absolute blast to upgrade ABP Dotnet Conference with a 1-day of workshops and an additional parallel session of talks! With ABP Dotnet Conference 2024, we marked a decade of innovation and community engagement. This year's event, besides being our second full-day(for both days!) ABP Community event, it has another special significance as we celebrated the 10th anniversary of ABP this year. The overwhelming interest and participation of live viewers and speakers from all around the world made this milestone truly memorable. 

From the nature of virtual conference, once again we were able to transcend geographical boundaries, uniting .NET developers from diverse cultures and 52 different countries. The map below showcases the countries of our live viewers, with darker shades indicating higher minutes viewed. Witnessing the global reach and impact of our conference fills us with immense pride and joy. We are grateful to each live viewer who dedicated their time and actively participated in the ABP Dotnet Conference 2024. Your presence and engagement played a crucial role in the success of the event.
