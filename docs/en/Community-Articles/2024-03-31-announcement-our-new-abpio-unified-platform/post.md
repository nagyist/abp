Hi ABP Community,

ðŸ“¢ We're excited to announce an improvement to your ABP.IO experience! In our ongoing effort to simplify and improve your interaction with our platform, we are working on a new design for ABP.IO and its subdomains. This update isn't just about aesthetics; it's a comprehensive enhancement aimed at unifying all our services under a single platform address: https://abp.io.



## Why are we making this change?

Whether you're developing with our open-source framework or using our commercial product, or looking for support; our goal is always to deliver the best experience possible. The new design will improve several aspects:

ðŸ”¹**Simplifying Navigation**: As the ABP.IO platform has grown rapidly, navigating through numerous subdomains has become challenging. We're transitioning to a well-structured mega menu system that will make navigation tidier and more straightforward. With everything under the ABP.IO domain, finding what you need will be easier.

ðŸŽ¨ **Enhancing User Experience**: We're introducing a fresh, modern design that not only looks better but also enhances functionality and ease of use.

ðŸ”Ž **Better SEO**: A unified domain improves our platform's discoverability, making it easier for new users to find us and for you to share resources with your peers.



## Which services are being unified?

âœ… The following websites will now be unified under ABP.IO:

- blog.abp.io ðŸ‘‰ abp.io/blog
- docs.abp.io ðŸ‘‰ abp.io/docs
- support.abp.io ðŸ‘‰ abp.io/support
- community.abp.io ðŸ‘‰ abp.io/community
- commercial.abp.io ðŸ‘‰ abp.io


> â›” The following websites will not be unified during this transition:  admin.abp.io, account.abp.io, nuget.abp.io


## What can you expect?

The new ABP.IO platform is designed with you in mind. Hereâ€™s what to look forward to:

- **Seamless Integration**: Transitioning from multiple subdomains to a single address without losing track of your favorite resources. We will keep many pages the same as before. Page-based transitions will be made over a longer period of time.

- **Improved Support and Documentation**: We will merge commercial and open-source docs into a single address so it'll be easier to access our documentation.

  

## Your journey with us during this transition

We know that change is overwhelming, but we are trying to provide a smooth transition. Here's how we're making it seamless for you:

ðŸš© **No Immediate Action Required**: Your existing bookmarks and links will continue to work, automatically redirecting you to the new unified platform.

ðŸŽ— **Stay Informed**: We will keep you updated with guides and support during the transition.

ðŸ“§ **Weâ€™re Here to Help**: Our support team is ready to assist you with any questions or concerns.  If you have any issues, you can contact us at our Discord channel or send an email to info@abp.io.
