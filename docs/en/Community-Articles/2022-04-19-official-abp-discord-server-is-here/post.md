### What is Discord?

 Discord is a free instant communication platform where people can send text messages, make voice calls, video chat, send files, and many more. Discord itself defines the platform as “Your Place to Talk and Hang Out”. You can say, it works like any other chat app such as Skype, or Slack. Despite this remains true, that’s not all Discord has to offer.

### What is Discord Server?

 Discord pivoted to a place where communities gather in specific servers to communicate with people who has common interests on Discord Servers in which users can socialize and exchange ideas, share tips and simply chat with each other about that specific topic they are interested in.

 Usually, Discord Servers include multi-channels to divide topics to be discussed within. To give an example, there are “General”, “Ideas”, “Tips”, “Questions”, “UI-Angular”, “UI-Blazor”, “UI-MVC”, and many more channels in ABP Discord Community. This way, specific ideas about specific topics are easier to follow and read for everyone, and the topics are not lost, easier to follow and read for everyone.

### What are Discord Servers Used For?

 In Discord Servers, users communicate with each other in a way that is convenient for them. Discord allows people to make voice calls, video chats, or simply text messages. Communities are created by wether fans of a specific topic(games, open-source frameworks, NFT, etc.) or by the official authorities of that specific topic(game creator, framework core team, creator of a token, etc).

 In ABP Community Discord Server’s case, it is a server created by official authorities with core team being present in the server along with the community members. Even though it is created for the framework community members to communicate with each other easily, everyone who is interested in following the latest news about ABP Platform are welcome to [join ABP Discord Server](https://discord.gg/wbcQAsUrs9)!
