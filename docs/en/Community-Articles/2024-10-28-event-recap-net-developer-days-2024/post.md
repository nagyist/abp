The ABP team has just returned from an incredible experience at .NET DeveloperDays 2024, and we’re thrilled to share the highlights of this fantastic event! In past years, we attended the conference as participants and had such a great time that we decided to take it a step further by sponsoring this year. As a gold sponsor for 2024, it was an unforgettable experience to engage with the vibrant .NET community in Warsaw. The energy at the event was terrific, and the opportunity to connect with developers, engineers, and industry leaders made it truly special.
