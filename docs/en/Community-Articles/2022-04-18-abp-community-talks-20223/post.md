 ABP Community Talks is the event where we gather as ABP Framework’s Community members to talk, and share ideas on a monthly basis. Before the talks, we collect ideas from our contributors, trending topics in the industry, ABP Platform’s news and updates, and more, to select the topics that will be talked about in every episode. After the topics are certain, we announce them on our social media and community channels.
 
 You are always welcome and encouraged to join, ask questions, make suggestions, or even be in the talks to make presentations about the topics that you think would be beneficial for the ABP Community.
